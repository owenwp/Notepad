Tengen Go 2010 Zombie Process Independent Game Development Project
<p>
An ancient Chinese board game for the iPad.  Allows two players to play 
head to head, or play online using an existing popular server.  I developed 
this application without assistance over the course of about a month and a 
half, and have continued to enhance it since.  Network communication uses Telnet, 
with a human readable protocol for player matchmaking and game logic.  
<p>
The game board and pieces are rendered using Core Graphics.  In particular, the white 
game pieces, traditionally made of clam shell, use masking and a pattern texture 
so that each one is slightly different.  Core Animation is also used extensively 
for the game pieces and other effects.  User interaction is modeled as closely as 
possible to a real game set.
<p>
This app required the use of a wide variety of user interface elements, including 
searching/filtering, custom table cells, table sorting, gesture recognizers, 
popover and modal views, pickers, and pervasive use of auto-rotation.  It is localized in three languages.  Due to the 
complexity of the server protocol, it has been a challenge to present every possible 
control state to the user in an intuitive fashion.  As a result, a large percentage 
of the interface is dynamic, with controls changing depending on the commands available 
from the server.
<p>
I have enjoyed fair success with this product, and have continued to add features occasionally.
