Space Renegade 2004-2006 Team Anachron Game Development Club Project
<p>
Space Renegade is a project that I began after joining team Anachron.
When the previous leader of the team graduated, I took his place and this
became the team's main project.  At this time, the team was small, and I had
done most of the programming for this project, with the exception of enemy AI.
Most of the design, however, was created by my team, as was all of the artwork.
<p>
This was not the first project that I had worked on in the GDC, but it was the first
that I had managed. Progress was fairly  slow, and in the end we did not have
very much content for our game. The end result  is something that is feature-complete and
fairly polished, but is more of a demo than a full game.
<p>
Requires an Nvidia Geforce 3 or greater, with Shader Model 1.1 support.
