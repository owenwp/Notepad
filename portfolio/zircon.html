Zircon Game Engine and Wolf Hole (working title) 2006-2007 
Team Anachron Game Development Club Project
<p>     
The Zircon engine is a 3D game engine engine which
I created for my team during the summer of 2006, and which  we have
collectively developed since. I had designed this engine to be general purpose, from the
ground up, using C# .Net,  Managed DirectX, and test-driven development. It
began with an interactive test framework that I made using  the NUnit testing library.
I then created a series of tests that acted as scaffolding to  build the
engine itself. The initial idea to build a game engine in this manner came from an
article on the MSDN network, and I used skills learned from  my
software engineering courses. The resulting engine has proven to be quite flexible, though it does
not yet scale well.
<p>
While I created the initial framework and directed 
development, the coding on this project has been well-distributed between a 
number of programmers, including myself. Approximately half of the code is my own at this point.  
Most of my work was in designing the architecture and low level
implementation.  My  team created most of the gameplay related code, and some of the
collision algorithms.
<p>
The main thing to see for the engine itself is the test framework.
ZirconTest will open a testing GUI which will show a set of categorized unit
tests, each of which will show some aspect of the engine's design and features.
As I have mentioned, these tests were written in advance of the code which they
use.  Please check the readme included in ZirconTest for more information on how
to use this interface.
<p>
You must install the Microsoft .Net framework 2.0 to run this engine.
<p>            
Wolf Hole is the game project which has spawned from
the Zircon engine. It has been in active development for two months, and has
since been driving the development of the  engine itself, though the two have been kept
separate to simplify the design of the game  itself. It is currently in a
state that is functional but is not ready for general distribution. I include it  simply as
an example of what can be done with the engine in a fairly
short time-frame. You will note particularly the poor framerate and placeholder projectiles.
<p>          
The primary feature of this game demo
is  the procedurally generated dungeon, made in the style of Nethack or Diablo, which can be found under
the Saloon.  This is accomplished by linking together instances  of BSP rooms.
<p>
May not run on Windows 7 and/or 64bit Windows versions.
