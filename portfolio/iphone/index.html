<p>
Hello,
<br>    
My name is Owen Pedrotti, and these are the finished projects that I 
have worked on for the iPhone OS.  I have been working with the iOS SDK for about a year and a half, primarily on game and 
entertainment software.  My areas of specialization are in software 
engineering and computer graphics, and I have worked to bring these 
strengths into developing attractive and responsive applications for 
the iPhone and iPad.
<p>
Thank you very much for your time,<br>
Owen Pedrotti
