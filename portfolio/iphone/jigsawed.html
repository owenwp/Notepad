<p>
An existing application which I was contracted to enhance.  My most significant contributions have been a major refactor and 
rewrite of the puzzle view itself primarily to support zooming and panning, iPad support, and in-app purchase.  <p>
In addition to adding the ability to zoom in and out of the puzzle view at high resolution, I also re-designed the 
puzzle pieces so that they could be joined together and manipulated seamlessly as groups, without any shadow overlap artifacts.  
A great deal of work went into optimizing this code due to memory limitations on older devices.
<p>
The addition of iPad support was fairly straightforward.  My model for its design was the Mail application, 
using a master-detail split view to present the main menu and image picker.  In-app purchase was implemented using JSON to 
retrieve product information from a server.  Once a purchase is made, the pack of puzzle images is retrieved as a Zip file.  
The user experience is designed to be familiar to users of the App Store, with preview images and progress bars for downloads.
