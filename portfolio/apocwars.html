A 2.5D mobile strategy game developed in Unity with a team of around 10 people, with elements of time management and realtime base attack combat.  
I worked mainly on the rendering and tools.  We used NGUI for the user interface and 2D sprite assets, combined with 3D cell-shaded models for 
vehicles and turrets.   Soft shadows for 3D objects and walls are baked from geometry using an editor tool, then batched together at runtime into 
a single skeletal mesh which Unity can update in a background thread.  
<p>
The terrain is drawn in tiles which tessellate like the tiles in Carcassonne.  They are placed procedurally along with billboarded props to give each 
base unique surroundings.  To suppliment Unity's particle system, I created a bullet tracer system which creates smoothly animating streaks in a dynamic 
vertex buffer for guns and lasers.  Our artists wanted a lot of combat effects, so I created extensive LOD and pooling systems to ensure low end 
hardware support.
<p>
I created a dynamic fog of war system that enabled our spying gameplay mechanic, where you can send special units to reveal the enemy base before attacking.  
This was done using a secondary downward facing camera that renders blob textures into an accumulation buffer, progressively blending away parts of an 
alpha mask, which is then applied to an animated fog mesh covering the base. 
<p>
I also implemented several workflow systems, in particular an import/export system to save game balance data into a spreadsheet which can be edited and 
published to our game servers and loaded at runtime.  Implemented and managed an automated build and deployment system for continuous integration.
I also worked on social networking integration, the in app purchase system, editor tools for designing base structures and 
building texture atlases.
<p>
We launched the game recently worldwide and are actively continuing to add features.
