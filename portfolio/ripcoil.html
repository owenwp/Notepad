Ripcoil 2016 Sanzaru Games
<p>
A competitive online VR game where players attempt to throw discs past each other in futuristic arenas. 
Designed for standing play, you lean to the left and right to drive a hovering platform across the front of your goal.
<p>
Implemented player inverse kinematics system and body size compensation. Created systems for standing mode tracking and calibration, 
and worked on refinements for the leaning-based movement system. I lead the effort for optimization and scalability, implementing 
options and fallbacks for low end hardware. I was also responsible for fixing general image quality and graphical issues, and refining 
shader effects and animation blueprints.
