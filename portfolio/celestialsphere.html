2007 Team GigaFlops WPI IMGD 3000 Class Project, 
2008 Independant Game Festival Student Showcase entry.
<p> 
Celestial Sphere was made as a final project for  an IMGD (Interactive Media and Design) 
Technical Game Design 3000 level class. My role was  to write all of the code for the 
camera, movement, scripting, and game logic. Some user interface programming 
and initial physX integration was done by another team member, as was all of the 
artwork and most of the level design. 
<p>           
The purpose of the 
project was to design and implement a full and complete game using an existing 
game engine  (C4, Terathon Software). This was originally a four-week project, which 
was later revisited and polished for the IGF Student Showcase
<p>
WASD is used to move, left and right arrow keys to turn the camera.
<p>
This game requires an Nvidia GeForceFX 5200 or greater to run. You must also run the 
included PhysX driver installer before playing.  A PhysX card is not required.
