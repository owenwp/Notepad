Guitar Storm 2008-2009 Zombie Process Independant Game Development Project
<p>
This is an open source project being made by myself.  It allows players to
play along with songs using a real guitar.  Gameplay is similar to Guitar Hero
or Rock Band, with a visual representation of the music scrolling by, and scoring
that rewards players who can continue a long streak without missing a note.  It
uses the widely accepted Guitar Pro format for storing guitar tablature, and plays
mp3s from the player's music collection in time with the game.
<p>
The guitar input is handled using a Fourier transform to determine the position
of the note played on a chromatic scale, in much same way as a digital guitar tuner.
The scrolling note chart is made to strongly resemble guitar tab texts which many
guitarists are accustomed to reading.  Mp3 music is kept separate from the tablature
and other data to facilitate distribution without infringing upon any copyrights.
Players should be able to download a song, then simply locate an mp3 which may already
be in their possession and have it synchronize correctly without any further configuration.
Players may also practice with a metronome at any speed instead of the mp3 backing.
<p>
I used a variety of open source libraries and artwork, some of which I modified to 
suit this project.  Reading the Guitar Pro tabs was particularly challenging since
the format is not officially documented, and files still need some cleaning in order to load.
The game is currently playable with some bugs, but there are few guitar tabs available
that are suitable for play since their authors rarely time them with the original music
perfectly. 
<p>
Its current state is somewhat playable, I hope to revisit it at some point in the future 
and provide a release with some good example songs.
