Using Oculus Avatars with VOIP, you can sit across from your friends and chat over a nice game, or even teach your friends how to play in an intuitive way. Challenge yourself by playing with people all over the world through the [Online Go Server](https://online-go.com/), or try out the latest freely available Go AI programs such as Leela.
